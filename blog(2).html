        <h1>Blog: Being Judged</h1>
        
        <div class="card">
            <h2>Why you should care less about being judged:</h2>
            <h5>It's unhealthy:</h5>
            <p>• it's root is uncertainty and always on pins and needles
                • low self-esteem or straight out pride
                • drained emotionally/no energy at the end of every interaction
                • can cause imposter syndrome, in response by putting your being to subject under other people's thinking who you are which triggers you to (maybe) set off another personality than what you have yourself.
                • prompts to expect</p>
            <h5>It's unconventional:</h5>
            <p> • doing the  this notion or counter-acting towards this or developing this 'caring for judgement' is just as worse because since weaning off of judgement is a huge "hard-to-do" thing because it requires a whole perspective-shift without balancing out your life. For a generally anxious person.. This judgment may be the base of everything; of how you know to perform in daily life, interpreting what is right from a room full of wrongs.
                • But if I am to say, I'd much rather be of my own judgement/God's as in being a christian does apply. This judgement includes taking suggestions and not final words/decisions. 
              </p>
            <h6>ALSO</h6><p>Talking about coming out of this constant state of judgement fear:
                If you're like me, you probably realize how judgement has taken over your life and by this fear -mongering you into whole another substance than what you were. Although I know I can't go back to what I was.. what I can do is conform myself; by this I've learned some key-points to make sense of and engrave in my heart by which are:
                
                • what state I want to be according to who I am.
                • How I'm going to change
                (only follow along IF you relate)</p>
            <h6>point 1.  peaceful in terms of having healthy boundaries and relationships & flexible to learning^</h6><p>point 2. 

                Apply the "NO rules, only ideas" action:
                which means when it comes to judgment, you constantly apply how the idea of the problem AFFECTS you and see if its healthy for who you are a person ,grasp core and not just the rules that apply to the situation.
                </p>
            <p>for example: if someone said "you stink" and think about it as an insult rather than concern to your health or their discomfort, you are subconsciously agreeing to "this" and resorting to make the stinking something they won't accept you for but in actuality, its a prone to discomfort and health issue, do take the idea behind it and not the rules that it enforces upon you, understand whats at the core and choose whatever this example can be to you for your interpretation/gain.</p>
