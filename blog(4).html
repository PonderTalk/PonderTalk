        <h1>1. Overbearing with others.</h1>
        <p>It kept me constantly degrading others' opinions because of how I was comfortable being in the level which I possessed the most power.</p>
        <h3>How I got out of this:</h3>
        <p>I realized that this kind of behavior is directly aligned to the fear of being perceived by others from my own point of view. Of how hideous I was to myself. So for me, the core of the problem led to who I saw myself as a person (self-esteem struggles and whatnot).</p>

        <div id="section2">
            <h1>2. Owner of a closed mind</h1>
            <p>This may be the most basic sign and side effect of thinking that I am high and mighty.</p>
            <h3>How I got out of this:</h3>
            <p>I realized this roots from an under-average acceptance that we all are just human and none of us are higher than the former or latter. I am still overcoming and learning every day that each of us goes through different phases of life. To some, this makes them weaker at heart or stronger in other cases, but this shows that humans are ethically and at the core, ever-learning beings. I also realized the importance of understanding that many people get down-witted because of the close-mindedness they face, which keeps them stuck in the process of tying the loose ends of the huge curveball that is their mind.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="section3">
            <h1>3. Bare minimum being the absolute gold</h1>
            <p>What I mean by this is, A woke person about their lack of care to anyone else's input but themselves tends to suffice this lack by performing the bare minimum of efforts to another or anything that doesn't fit my judgement.
            </p>
            <h3>How I got out of this:</h3>
            <p>I got out of this by not performing things that were bare minimum and kept to myself for a while which was fasting in a way to alert myself about my attitudes and took a turn to ask everyone around me about how they felt and I noticed how fleeting hours went by as I saw these new perspectives that which once made me scuff because I thought had all I needed and I realized that the human is an ever-learning being not conformed to any patterns but in capability of changing what they do. even if it means working through the "patterns".</p>

        </div>

        <div id="section4">
         <h1>4. To keep sanity: random acts of good </h1>
            <p>which won't get commended or will depending on the crowd around them.</p>
            <h3>How I got out of this</h3>
            <p>I would start normalizing my acts of good as a pattern and consider them as something to not applause or keep my sanity for but as daily activities that just adds meaning to my life and not in a way where that is the only way I have a sense of self. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="section5">
            <h1>5.Other cases and observations.</h1>
            <p>I've noticed that when an overly narcissistic person do any deeds for instance, it.. to them is like they've blessed the world or kind of like everything they do is self-deprecating for them but only done for the fact that they and I quote "love" others. It made a chore for them </p>
            <h3>How I see them getting out of this</h3>
            <p>Unwinding traumas and confronting selfishness plus arrogance.

        </div>

        <div id="section6">
            <h1>6. Infecting others in the surrounding with the same mindset.</h1>
            <p>infecting others in the surrounding with the same mindset so I'll never have to grow up from this state and step into newness. </p>
            <h3>How I got out of this</h3>
            <p>I felt a huge amount of guilt for doing because of obvious reasons but in another perspective not only is it harming our wits but it's attacking the good of the many in having them being stuck in this constant mentality of arrogance in themselves.</p>
