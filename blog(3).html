        <div class="card">
            <h2>Toxicity: part 1:</h2>
            <h5>intro: these are two sides of feeling worthlessness and my views on it:</h5>
            <h5>there are two sides of the spectrum in being toxic, either being introspective or in obversely,</h5>
            <p>Introspective: Low self- esteem, is something I've dealt with feeling worthless, I would go around thinking I was hope-less in turn not producing the quality I can give but because I thought I was worthless, I become fully dependent on my self-esteem.
                So points:
            </p>
            <p>No.1.......You produce without quality because you don't believe you can, thinking you're worthless.
                </p>
                <p>No.2.......overall low quality of life and negative emotions that reinforce more feelings of worthlessness than anything else,that will lead to more and more "reasons" why you are "worthless" also making the person prone to be dependent relationship vise.)</p>
            <h5>Obversely:</h5>
            <p> 
             Worthlessness can cause pride by trying to counteract this feeling of worthlessness being into consideration. Being a precursor of a action taken to feel worthy. But these actions by time, reinforces a pattern of "worthless until proven otherwise" by your works and what-not, it ends up basing your whole life on giving/taking to loving yourself only if you achieve. 

              </p>
            <p>no.1........always needing a reason to be loved by others and themselves elevating them into being on the top of all things but having a false sense of self, and pride overtaken self-centeredness. Everything about them will lead to this "give and take" thing and not genuine connection & providence triggered by genuine wanting. 
            </p>
            <p>no.2.......(in toxic terms) As making everything below them(or so to make them feel worthy enough of love) gets them a high only from finishing work by this resciprocating a not-so-regulated and declined sense of self...slowly declining in social situations... Making achievements the only source of love they receive. either this sense of love stems from parents or other external source of love which is the case in many.., the problem in this case is more so of the narcissim or worthlessness ends of the spectrums that cause major deprivation in a childs mind, in either cases </p>
            
            <h6>CONCLUSION:
            </h6><p>Pure love usually intends to be giving consideration/re-assurance/validation, is the right kind of love to give to a child by their parents in-turn giving them a regulated sense of self and achievements coming from a place of building upon their character and improving their character, but as this isn't furthered enough..upon the child, as in...this being the superiority in love between the child and the parent whilst also enforcing "mutualism" in the areas of love is also essential in showing how the child manages coming relationships in their life. So be mindful for how kids are raised that cosideration&assurance&validation is the superior trait and the foundation of whihc the child learn love.
            <p>As of the biggest pointer of (TOXIC) self-consciousness's root cause being parents, I say that this kind of consideration as in making the child subject to love only if the child does "x,y,z", is indeed toxic. While it does keep the child accountable, it is toxic when this is the only precursor to love the child owns, making them subject to feeling unworthy if they don't perform what you want them to. (KEYWORD: ONLY)</p>

            <p>finally, its all about regulatory techniques as in acceptance and growth by daily improvement, realizing that the human is an ever-growing subject. And the enthusiasm of curiosity helps to lead a quite/loud but significant life.</p>
