## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm PonderTalk, I type down things of observations and intent purposes of reaching out to mental health studies and purposes in learning more about phsychology with my perspective plus approach. If you are going to use my work in any-ways shape or form please, cite so it can reach the audience I intent to. I also encourage you to reach out to me for more ideas on blog! 

To let it sink..?

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... to dive deep into patterns and basic knowledge in psychology.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... more ideas on blog, ofc :)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... Anything related to the human mind so that I can ponder, (yes, intended choice of wording)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ... by my mail! on my profile or just the link provided on my website at the footer!!
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...I like psychology as much as I like breathing(living is the intent)
--> Thanks for reading this! Hope to see your input from which I can release more 'outputs'.
