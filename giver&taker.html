            <h5>When Dependence in Relationships Turns Toxic</h5>
            <p>When someone in a relationship doesn't take care of their own emotions and responsibilities and starts relying excessively on their partner, the relationship can become parasitic and mutually binding. Hereâ€™s how this unfolds from both an emotional and psychological perspective:</p>
            <h5>Emotional Framework</h5>
            <h6>Lack of Personal Growth:</h6> <p>The dependent person stops growing in their abilities, slacking off on daily challenges and strategic learning. This stagnation keeps them immature compared to those who continue to grow and learn.</p>
            <h6>Feelings of Worthlessness:</h6><p>This stagnation leads to feelings of worthlessness, pushing the person to engage in futile activities to fill their time and convince themselves of their value.</p>
            <h6>Mood Dependence:</h6><p>The dependent person experiences significant mood lifts only when their partner is around, struggling to find joy in the company of others.</p>
            <h6>Diminished Value of Others:</h6><p>Other relationships become insignificant, while the partner's value skyrockets, creating a toxic dynamic where the partner is seen as the only source of emotional fulfillment.</p>
            <h6>Idealization:</h6><p>Instead of fostering a balanced relationship, the dependent person compensates for their lack of effort by placing their partner on a pedestal, believing they can do no wrong.</p>
            <h6>Neglect of Daily Activities:</h6><p>The dependent person begins to neglect their daily activities, increasingly relying on their partner for both emotional and practical support.</p>
            <h5>Psychological Framework</h5>
            <h6>Need for Constant Reassurance:</h6><p>As these emotions take hold, the dependent person requires constant reassurance and attention. This can be overwhelming for the partner, as the dependent person expects them to meet all their emotional needs.</p>
            <h6>Boundary Issues:</h6><p>The dependent person may become oblivious to boundaries, easily manipulated, and overly trusting of their partner while neglecting other relationships.</p>
